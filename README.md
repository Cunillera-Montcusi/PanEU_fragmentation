Abstract  
Landscape degradation represents a main driver of current diversity crisis although its long-term consequences are difficult to quantify. Aquatic landscapes (waterscapes) are critically threatened by human activities fostering their degradation. However, the understanding of the potential effect of waterscape degradation on biodiversity at large spatial scales—biomes, continents—is scarce. In this work, we explore the potential trends in diversity decay in response to waterscape degradation across Europe. We built the European waterscapes based on available satellite data and simulated diversity patterns using a coalescent metacommunity model run for each European ecoregion and considering nine dispersal abilities. Then, we generated a gradient of waterscape degradation systematically removing a percentage of habitats and recalculating ecoregions diversities. Overall, for each ecoregion, dispersal ability, and degradation level we obtained theoretical gamma diversity values. We summarised the depicted diversity decay trends in two parameters: the proportional decay rate and the collapsing rate, which respectively informed about the velocity in diversity loss and its acceleration as waterscape is degraded. Finally, we mapped these parameters across Europe and related them with ecoregion structural descriptors (i.e. geographic location, water cover, connectivity, and size). We identified ecoregions’ sensitivities to waterscape degradation and the overall variation on their diversity decay values. Connectivity and water cover were main descriptors of diversity decay, being more heterogeneous ecoregions generally more resistant to waterscape degradation. Our study provides a first order approximation to the urgently required information about the expected rate of freshwater diversity decrease due to waterscape degradation at a continental scale, its differences across regions, and its main structural drivers. Thus, it can greatly complement conservation practices as well as open the door to incorporate novel approximations in management to better understand the consequences of one of the major threads to diversity and improve overall resilience to the coming fragmented future.
